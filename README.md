Bro this took so long, but it was loads of fun.

Here are the commands to install the CLI stuff on Mac.

```bash
brew uninstall ffmpeg
cd ~
git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git
brew install yasm
brew install pkg-config
pkg-config --cflags librsvg-2.0
./configure --enable-librsvg
make install # this took AGES!
```

You have to install ffmpeg, but build it alongside librsvg (to handle the SVG images). The docs for this were terribleâ€”or at least _I_ couldn't find them. I eventually got it working though.

In my folder of .svg images, I ran this command... 

```bash
ffmpeg -framerate 25 -pattern_type glob -i '*.svg' output.mp4
```

Pretty self explanatory. The `-pattern_type glob` thing just allows for multiple SVGs to be selected at once.
